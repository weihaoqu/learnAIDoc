Tools that shift AI from a "crutch" to a "lever" for deep understanding—implementing high-engagement learning patterns.

## Why This Matters

Research shows that *how* you interact with AI determines learning outcomes. These tools are designed to keep you cognitively engaged rather than passively consuming AI output.

## The Tools

### DeepTutor
**Core Function:** Conceptual Knowledge Bases

Developed by the HKU Data Science Lab, DeepTutor processes textbooks and papers to create interactive knowledge bases. Supports deep research through:
- Interactive visualizations
- Charts and animations
- Structured concept exploration

**GitHub:** [github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor)

---

### PageLM
**Core Function:** Interactive Recitation

An open-source platform that transforms PDFs or Markdown files into interactive learning content:
- Auto-generated quizzes
- Flashcards for spaced-repetition
- Podcast audio generation

**GitHub:** [github.com/CaviraOSS/pagelm](https://github.com/CaviraOSS/pagelm)

---

### Frontend-Slides
**Core Function:** Visual Mental Models

A Claude Code Skill that creates animated HTML presentations. Helps visualize:
- Complex system designs
- Architectural principles
- Technical concepts

No deep CSS/JS knowledge required.

### PDF3MD
**Core Function:** Content Portability

Simplifies the conversion of PDF files to Markdown or Word for easier editing and integration into other learning tools.

## Mapping to High-Engagement Patterns

| Tool | Learning Pattern | How It Helps |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| DeepTutor | Conceptual Inquiry | Build mental models before coding |
| PageLM | Generation-Then-Comprehension | Test yourself, find gaps |
| Frontend-Slides | Hybrid Code-Explanation | Visualize to understand |
| PDF3MD | Content Portability | Convert PDFs for use in other tools |

These tools support the principle: **stay cognitively engaged, even when AI assists**.
