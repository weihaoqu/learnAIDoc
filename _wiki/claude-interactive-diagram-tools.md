Claude can build fully functional, interactive diagram tools from a single detailed prompt — no coding required. Describe what you want to learn and how you want to interact with it, and Claude creates a working application.

## What It Can Build

The showcase example is an **interactive anatomy explorer** with medical-grade SVG illustrations, but the approach works for any subject — molecular structures, system architectures, circuit diagrams, concept maps, and more.

Features of the anatomy example:

- **Dual-view explorer** — Toggle between full-body and brain anatomy
- **Interactive hover/click** — Hover for quick info, click for detailed descriptions
- **System filters** — Tabs to isolate specific body systems (skeletal, nervous, etc.)
- **Sound design** — Subtle audio feedback for physical interaction feel
- **Premium design** — Serif headings, warm color palette, polished layout

## The Workflow

| Step | What to do |
|------|-----------|
| **1. Describe the task** | Write a detailed design brief — specify the learning experience, visual style, and interaction patterns you want |
| **2. Give context** | Enable file creation; optionally turn on Extended Thinking for complex apps |
| **3. Claude creates** | Claude builds a fully functional React app as an artifact, ready to use |
| **4. Iterate** | Refine with follow-up prompts — add quizzes, expand content, tweak interactions |

## Why This Is Amazing

The key insight is treating Claude as a **product designer**, not just a code generator. Instead of asking for "a diagram of the human body," you describe the *experience* you want — and Claude delivers a polished, interactive application that feels professionally built.

This works because Claude can:

- Generate complex SVG illustrations inline
- Build complete React components with state management
- Design thoughtful UX with hover states, animations, and filtering
- Produce self-contained artifacts that run in the browser with zero setup
