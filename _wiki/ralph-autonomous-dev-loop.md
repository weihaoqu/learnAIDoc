Today I learned about [Ralph](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) — a framework that wraps Claude Code in an autonomous development loop. You give it a task list, and it runs Claude Code repeatedly — executing, tracking progress, and continuing — until the project is done or it hits a safety limit.

## The Problem Ralph Solves

Normally with Claude Code, you prompt → Claude works → you review → you prompt again. For large tasks (build a feature, fix 20 bugs, implement a spec), this manual loop is tedious. You're just feeding it the next task over and over.

Ralph automates the entire cycle: load instructions → run Claude → track progress → check if done → repeat.

## How It Works

Ralph runs a 5-step loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Load PROMPT.md (your project goals)     │
│  2. Execute Claude Code with current tasks  │
│  3. Track progress, update task list        │
│  4. Check exit conditions                   │
│  5. Not done? → Go to step 1               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The key innovation is the **dual-condition exit gate** — Ralph only stops when:
- It detects **2+ completion indicators** (heuristic pattern matching)
- **AND** Claude explicitly outputs `EXIT_SIGNAL: true`

Both must be true. This prevents premature exits (Claude says "done" but isn't really) and infinite loops (heuristics say done but Claude wants to continue).

## Getting Started

### Install (one-time)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code.git
cd ralph-claude-code
./install.sh
```

This adds global commands: `ralph`, `ralph-monitor`, `ralph-setup`, `ralph-enable`, `ralph-import`.

### Enable in an Existing Project

```bash
cd my-project
ralph-enable
```

The interactive wizard:
1. Auto-detects project type (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust) and framework
2. Asks about task sources (beads, GitHub Issues, or PRD documents)
3. Configures permissions and loop parameters
4. Generates `.ralph/` directory with all config files

### Start the Loop

```bash
# Recommended: with tmux monitoring dashboard
ralph --monitor

# Or basic
ralph

# Resume a previous session
ralph --resume <session_id>
```

## Project Structure

All Ralph files live in `.ralph/`, keeping your project root clean:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.ralph/PROMPT.md` | High-level project goals and context |
| `.ralph/fix_plan.md` | Prioritized task list (Claude checks items off as it works) |
| `.ralph/AGENT.md` | Build/test commands (auto-detected) |
| `.ralph/specs/` | Detailed requirement docs (optional) |
| `.ralphrc` | Loop configuration (rate limits, timeouts, permissions) |

The flow: `PROMPT.md` (what to build) → `specs/` (details) → `fix_plan.md` (tasks) → `AGENT.md` (how to build/test)

## Real-World Use Cases

Say you have a product requirements doc and want Claude to implement it autonomously:

```bash
# Import your PRD and create Ralph project structure
ralph-import product-requirements.md my-app
cd my-app

# Review and adjust the generated task list
vim .ralph/fix_plan.md

# Let Ralph run — it will iterate until all tasks are done
ralph --monitor
```

Ralph loops through Claude Code sessions. Each iteration:
- Claude reads the current task list
- Works on the highest-priority incomplete task
- Commits code as it goes (git commits count as progress)
- Ralph checks what's done and loops again

You watch via the tmux monitoring dashboard. When all tasks in `fix_plan.md` are checked off and Claude signals completion, Ralph stops.

## How LearnAI Team Could Use This

- Use Ralph to work through long documentation cleanup lists where each task is explicit and testable.
- Convert PRDs or wiki improvement plans into `.ralph/fix_plan.md` so Claude Code iterates through them.
- Keep human review on publishing decisions, factual claims, and design/content judgment calls.

## Safety & Limits

Ralph has multiple safeguards against runaway loops and API waste:

| Safeguard | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Rate limit** | 100 calls/hour | Prevents API overuse |
| **Circuit breaker** | 3 no-progress loops | Stops if Claude is stuck |
| **Same-error limit** | 5 repeated errors | Stops if hitting the same bug |
| **Session expiry** | 24 hours | Auto-resets stale sessions |
| **Timeout per run** | 15 minutes | Caps each Claude execution |
| **5-hour API limit** | Auto-detected | Prompts you when Claude's usage ceiling hits |

The circuit breaker is smart — it uses two-stage filtering to avoid false positives (e.g., JSON containing the word "error" in a field name won't trigger it).

## Configuration (.ralphrc)

```bash
PROJECT_NAME="my-app"
PROJECT_TYPE="typescript"

# Loop behavior
MAX_CALLS_PER_HOUR=100
CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=15

# Tool permissions (what Claude is allowed to do)
ALLOWED_TOOLS="Write,Read,Edit,Bash(git *),Bash(npm *),Bash(pytest)"

# Session continuity
SESSION_CONTINUITY=true
SESSION_EXPIRY_HOURS=24

# Circuit breaker tuning
CB_NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD=3
CB_SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD=5
CB_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=30
```

## Commands Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ralph` | Start the autonomous loop |
| `ralph --monitor` | Loop + tmux dashboard |
| `ralph --live` | Loop with real-time streaming output |
| `ralph --resume <id>` | Continue a previous session with context |
| `ralph-enable` | Interactive wizard for existing projects |
| `ralph-import <file>` | Convert a PRD/spec into Ralph project |
| `ralph-setup <name>` | Create a new blank Ralph project |
| `ralph-monitor` | Standalone monitoring dashboard |
| `ralph-enable-ci` | Non-interactive setup for CI/CD pipelines |

## When to Use Ralph

**Good fit:**
- Implementing a full feature from a spec or PRD
- Working through a long bug/task list overnight
- CI/CD automation — let Ralph handle the implementation loop
- Projects where you want to "set and forget" for a few hours

**Not the right tool for:**
- Exploratory work where you need to review each step
- Quick one-off tasks (just use Claude Code directly)
- Tasks requiring frequent human judgment or design decisions
