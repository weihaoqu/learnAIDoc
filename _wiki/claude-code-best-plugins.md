## 1. Superpowers

Great for larger projects. Helps you plan, spins up subagents for research, and actually thinks through the problem before committing to a plan.

- Includes TDD, systematic debugging, and verification steps
- Stops Claude from shipping broken code and claiming it works

## 2. Frontend Design

Makes Claude actually care about visual design. Components come out polished, not generic AI-looking.

- Good for landing pages, dashboards, or anything user-facing where default output looks too template-y
- Pushes toward intentional typography, spacing, and color choices instead of safe defaults

## 3. Code Simplifier

Run it after a feature works. Cleans up the code without breaking anything.

- Focuses on recently modified files
- Good for when Claude wrote something functional but messy

## 4. Playground

Creates interactive single-file HTML tools. Spin up a data visualizer, design explorer, or concept map in one command.

- Self-contained, no dependencies
- Open the file in a browser and it just works

## 5. Claude in Chrome

Claude can see and interact with your browser. Read pages, click buttons, fill forms, navigate tabs.

- Debug live sites, scrape data, automate repetitive browser tasks
- Works with your actual logged-in session — no need to handle auth separately
- Pairs well with everything else

## 6. PR Review Toolkit

Suite of specialized review agents. Covers test coverage, error handling, type design, code quality, and simplification.

- More thorough than a single pass
- Each agent focuses on one thing and does it well

## Tips

- **Stack skills:** Combine multiple plugins based on your workflow. Superpowers for planning, Frontend Design for UI, PR Review when done.
- **Start small:** Pick one plugin and get comfortable before adding more. Once you get the hang of it, you can create your own for your workflow.
