Claude can transform handwritten notes and course outlines into professional, publication-ready educational materials — complete with LaTeX formatting, colored boxes, and textbook-quality typography.

## What It Does

Upload handwritten equations, notes, or a syllabus, and Claude produces:

- **Complete LaTeX source documents** with professional formatting
- **Compiled PDFs** ready for printing or distribution
- **Textbook-quality layout** — colored boxes, precise equations, margin notes, visual hierarchies

The example on the source page shows calculus integration notes turned into a six-page professional textbook chapter.

## The Workflow

| Step | What to do |
|------|-----------|
| **1. Describe the task** | Specify what course content you need — lecture notes, problem sets, study guides |
| **2. Provide context** | Upload handwritten notes as images, plus any existing course materials. Enable Extended Thinking for complex math |
| **3. Claude creates** | Generates a finished LaTeX document and compiled PDF with professional visual design |
| **4. Iterate** | Refine with follow-ups — add margin notes, call-out boxes, visual hierarchies, practice problems |

## Why This Matters

Creating professional course materials is one of the most time-consuming parts of teaching. The typical workflow — handwrite notes, manually typeset in LaTeX, fix formatting, compile, review — can take hours per lecture.

Claude collapses this into minutes:

- **Handwriting to LaTeX** — No more manual transcription of equations
- **Extended Thinking** — Handles complex mathematical notation accurately
- **Professional design** — Output looks like a published textbook, not a rough draft
- **Iterative refinement** — Ask for specific additions (practice problems, margin notes, summaries) without starting over

This is especially powerful for educators who know their content deeply but don't want to spend time on typesetting and layout.
