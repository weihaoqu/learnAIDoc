Shift AI from a "chat assistant" to a "thinking magnifier." Move from asking for answers to collaborative research and rigorous logic testing.

## The Mindset Shift

- **AI is a Lens**: Use it to see your work from a different angle (critic, student, skeptic)
- **10h → 60s**: Automate the grunt work of logic checking; focus on creative synthesis
- **You are the Master**: Prompts are tools; the real upgrade is how you direct the thinking

---

## I. Critical Analysis & Logic Verification

Best for reviewing drafts, grading papers, or evaluating complex arguments.

### 01 - Contradiction Finder

> "List all internal contradictions, unresolved conflicts, or evidence that is insufficient to support the points."

**Use case:** Identifying logical holes in long reports or marketing claims.

### 02 - The Picky Reviewer

> "Act like a picky peer reviewer. Be harsh. Focus on methodological flaws, missing controls, and overconfident conclusions."

**Use case:** Stress-testing academic papers or grant proposals before submission.

### 04-06 - Logic Stress-Test

> "Perform a reverse logic verification; compare against the scientific method; identify the single fatal weakness."

**Use case:** Finding the 'breaking point' of a theory or research hypothesis.

---

## II. Information Synthesis & Structuring

Use when you have raw data, meeting notes, or fragmented ideas needing professional organization.

### 03 - Formal Documentation

> "Organize these materials into a structured research brief: core points, evidence, hypotheses, and counterarguments."

**Use case:** Turning messy brainstorming or meeting transcripts into a formal draft.

### 10-13 - Structural Analysis

> "Analyze the framework of this argument; test the robustness of the structure; learn the 'pedagogy' behind this method."

**Use case:** Deconstructing how a successful paper or curriculum is built to replicate its quality.

---

## III. Cognitive Growth & Perspective Shifting

Use to overcome personal bias and simplify high-level concepts for teaching or decision-making.

### 07 - Belief Challenger

> "After analyzing all this content, what specific evidence or logic should change my current view/perspective?"

**Use case:** Fighting confirmation bias when evaluating new educational tech or research trends.

### 08 - Mental Model

> "Compress this entire topic into a single, memorable mental model or framework."

**Use case:** Distilling complex concepts (like Turing machines) into intuitive models for students.

### 09 - Cross-Domain Link

> "Identify the key questions that link this topic to other fields or cognitive models."

**Use case:** Finding interdisciplinary connections for grant applications or new course modules.

## Quick Reference Table

| Category | Prompts | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Critical Analysis | 01, 02, 04-06 | Reviewing, grading, evaluating arguments |
| Synthesis | 03, 10-13 | Raw data → structured documents |
| Cognitive Growth | 07, 08, 09 | Overcoming bias, teaching, decisions |

## Example Workflow

1. **Dump raw notes** into Claude
2. **Use #03** to structure into research brief
3. **Use #01** to find contradictions
4. **Use #02** for harsh peer review
5. **Use #08** to extract a mental model for teaching
6. **Use #07** to challenge your own assumptions

This keeps you cognitively engaged while AI handles the systematic analysis.
