Today I learned about "Vibe Marketing" — a concept from Greg Isenberg (Silicon Valley entrepreneur). His point: **while you're still Vibe Coding, you should already be Vibe Marketing.** Most founders get stuck at step 1 (building the product) and never move on.

## The 4-Step Framework

Greg breaks the AI-native product launch into four steps:

### Step 1: Build with AI (where most people stop)

Use AI to write code and ship the product. Backend, auth, infrastructure — get the core functionality done.

This is "Vibe Coding" — the part everyone's already doing.

### Step 2: Design a Marketing Playbook with AI

Use AI to create your entire marketing strategy:

- **Content format** — what types of posts work for your audience
- **Hook copywriting** — attention-grabbing openers
- **Lead-gen product** — free tools or content that drive signups
- **Reply rules** — how to engage with comments and DMs
- **Brand tone** — consistent voice across all channels
- **Weekly experiments** — what to test each week

This is the step most founders skip. The product is done, but there's no system for getting it in front of people.

### Step 3: Let AI Agents Execute 24/7

Hand the playbook to AI agents that run it around the clock:

- Auto-post content on schedule
- Auto-run ad campaigns
- Auto-reply to comments and DMs
- Auto-follow up with interested users
- Auto-repurpose content for secondary distribution

The key shift: marketing goes from a manual task you dread to an automated system you monitor.

### Step 4: Read the Data, Double Down

Look at the metrics and decide where to invest more:

- Bookmarks, shares, replies → content resonance
- Clicks, signups → conversion effectiveness
- These indicators tell you what's working and what to cut

## The Core Insight

Most founders finish building and then ask: **"Why is nobody using this?"**

The answer is they stopped at step 1. Building the product is only the beginning — without a marketing system, nobody knows it exists. Vibe Marketing means applying the same AI-first mindset you used for coding to the entire go-to-market process.

## How This Connects to Vibe Coding

| | Vibe Coding | Vibe Marketing |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Build the product with AI | Market the product with AI |
| **AI role** | Writes code, handles infrastructure | Writes copy, runs campaigns, engages users |
| **Human role** | Direct the vision, review output | Set strategy, review metrics |
| **Mistake** | Over-polishing before launching | Never starting at all |

The pattern is the same: describe what you want, let AI do the heavy lifting, review and iterate. The only difference is what you're building — code vs. distribution.
