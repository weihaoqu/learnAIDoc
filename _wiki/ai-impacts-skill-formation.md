A study investigating how AI assistance affects the acquisition of technical skills—specifically conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging.

## Experiment Setup

- **Participants:** 52 professional and freelance software developers
- **Task:** Gain mastery of Trio, a Python async programming library
- **Method:** Randomized between-subjects experiment (AI assistant vs. no AI)
- **Evaluation:** 14-question quiz on conceptual, code reading, and debugging problems

## Key Findings

### Significant Skill Erosion
Using AI assistance resulted in a **17% reduction** in post-task evaluation scores compared to the control group.

### The Debugging Gap
The largest performance difference occurred in debugging questions. The control group became more capable because they were forced to resolve errors independently.

### The Efficiency Wash
No statistically significant acceleration in completion time when using AI. Time saved on coding was consumed by time spent interacting with and querying the AI.

### Shift in Effort
AI decreased active coding time, shifting human effort toward reading and understanding AI-generated output.

## AI Interaction Patterns

How a person interacts with AI determines whether they learn or simply "offload" their thinking.

### High-Scoring Patterns (65%-86%)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generation-Then-Comprehension** | Generate code first, then use AI follow-up questions to understand the logic |
| **Hybrid Code-Explanation** | Compose queries demanding both code and detailed explanation of principles |
| **Conceptual Inquiry** | Only ask high-level conceptual questions, write code independently |

### Low-Scoring Patterns (24%-39%)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Delegation** | Ask AI to write code and paste it blindly as final answer |
| **Progressive AI Reliance** | Start independently but abdicate all thinking when difficulty arises |
| **Iterative AI Debugging** | Use AI as a "correction machine" without understanding why errors occurred |

## Implications for AI Literacy

### Preserving Cognitive Autonomy
Productivity is not a shortcut to competence. Stay cognitively engaged even when assisted.

### The Value of "Necessary Pain"
Encountering and resolving errors independently builds "mental muscle". Don't outsource the struggle.

### Supervision over Execution
As AI moves from "doing" to "proposing," humans must move from "doing" to "supervising". This requires **stronger**—not weaker—code reading and debugging skills.

### Sustainable Expertise
Long-term professional development depends on maintaining expertise amid AI proliferation. Learn high-engagement interaction patterns (like Conceptual Inquiry) rather than mere prompt engineering for output.
